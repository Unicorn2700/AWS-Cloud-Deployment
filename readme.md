# AWS Cloud Deployment Project

This project demonstrates the deployment of a live web server on AWS EC2 using Ubuntu Linux and Nginx. The objective of this project was to gain practical, hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure provisioning, Linux server management, and real-world web deployment on a public cloud platform.

## AWS Services Used
This project utilizes core AWS cloud services and Linux tools to simulate a real-world deployment environment.

**Key services and tools used:**
- Amazon EC2 for virtual cloud server hosting  
- Ubuntu Linux as the server operating system  
- Nginx as the web server for deployment  
- AWS Security Groups for firewall configuration  
- Public IP networking for internet accessibility  
- SSH for secure remote server access  

## Deployment Workflow
The deployment process involved launching and configuring a cloud server, connecting securely, installing required software, and hosting a live website accessible over the internet.

**Steps performed:**
- Launched EC2 instance on AWS using Ubuntu  
- Generated and configured secure SSH key pair  
- Enabled HTTP and SSH access via security groups  
- Connected to server using SSH from local machine  
- Updated system packages and installed Nginx  
- Created and deployed a custom HTML webpage  
- Hosted website on EC2 public IP  
- Verified deployment and server status  

## Project Screenshots
The repository contains screenshots demonstrating the complete deployment workflow:

- EC2 instance running on AWS console  
- Live website hosted on public IP  
- SSH terminal connected to server  
- Nginx web server running confirmation  

## Key Learnings
Through this project, I gained practical exposure to real-world cloud and DevOps workflows. I learned how to provision and manage cloud servers, configure networking and firewall rules, and deploy web applications on a Linux-based environment.

**Core skills developed:**
- Cloud server provisioning on AWS  
- Linux server and file system management  
- Web server installation and configuration  
- Networking and security fundamentals  
- End-to-end deployment workflow  

## Project Outcome
Successfully deployed and hosted a live website on AWS cloud infrastructure using EC2 and Nginx. This project demonstrates foundational knowledge of cloud computing, deployment practices, and DevOps fundamentals relevant to Cloud and Software Engineering roles.
